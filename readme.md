**Credit Card Fraud Detection Model**


This repository contains a credit card fraud detection model trained using logistic regression. The model aims to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on features extracted from the provided dataset.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection. It contains a labeled set of credit card transactions, with features anonymized for privacy reasons.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (sklearn)

**Usage**
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/izuasomba/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

**Copy code
jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb**
or

**Copy code
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py**

**Model**
The logistic regression algorithm is used for this binary classification problem. The model is trained on the provided dataset and aims to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

**Results**
The model's performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to effectively detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
